# To be able to set hostname on Ubuntu 16.04. we need to have vagrant at least
# of version 1.8.3 See also: https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant/issues/7288
Vagrant.require_version ">= 1.8.3"

# All Vagrant configuration is done below. The "2" in Vagrant.configure
# configures the configuration version (we support older styles for
# backwards compatibility). Please don't change it unless you know what
# you're doing.

  # The most common configuration options are documented and commented below.
  # For a complete reference, please see the online documentation at

  # Every Vagrant development environment requires a box. You can search for
  # boxes at https://atlas.hashicorp.com/search.

  # Set VM hostname
  config.vm.hostname = "my-stamps.local"

  # boxes will only be checked for updates when the user runs
  # `vagrant box outdated`. This is not recommended.

  # Create a forwarded port mapping which allows access to a specific port
  # within the machine from a port on the host machine. In the example below,
  # accessing "localhost:8080" will access port 80 on the guest machine.
  config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 80, host: 8080

  # Provider-specific configuration so you can fine-tune various
  # backing providers for Vagrant. These expose provider-specific options.
  # Example for VirtualBox:
  #
  config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |vb|
    # Display the VirtualBox GUI when booting the machine
    #vb.gui = true

    # Customize the amount of memory on the VM:
    vb.memory = "512"

    # Set the name that appears in the VirtualBox GUI
    vb.name = "my-stamps"
  end

  # Enable provisioning with Ansible from the Vagrant host.
